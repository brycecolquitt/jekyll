	<h1> Welcome to our blog</h1>
	<p>It's a blog about technology and education and stuff. You'll like it.</p>

		<li>Ok so this is my last test.</li>
		<li>If I have this down then I'm going to try Jekyll.</li>
		<li>What I think will happen is, I'll commit this to the homepage, and then make a pull request to the master.</li>
